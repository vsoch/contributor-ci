  extract_save_format:
    description: |
      Given using extract, change the default save format / structure from year/month/day to something else.
      This will force extraction of new data since we can't reliably say when it was last done. If you need
      to change the save format but want to use a cache, it's recommended to not change the format, but clean
      up directories you don't need after.
